<i> Visual Basic How to Program 3rd edition </i> incorporates an easy-to-follow, carefully developed early classes and early objects approach with comprehensive coverage of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. It includes a new, optional automated teller machine (ATM) case study that teaches the fundamentals of software engineering and object-oriented design with the UML 2.0. There are additional integrated case studies throughout the book including: the Time class, the Employee class and the GradeBook class. We provide discussions of more advanced topics such as XML, ASP.NET, ADO.NET and Web services as well as new topic coverage of partial classes, generics, the My namespace and Visual Studio 2005's updated debugger&nbsp; features.
