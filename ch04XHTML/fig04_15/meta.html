      <h1>Welcome to Our Website!</h1>

      <p>We have designed this site to teach about the wonders 
      of <strong><em>XHTML</em></strong>. <em>XHTML</em> is   
      better equipped than <em>HTML</em> to represent complex 
      data on the Internet. <em>XHTML</em> takes advantage of 
      XML's strict syntax to ensure well-formedness. Soon you 
      will know about many of the great features of 
      <em>XHTML.</em></p>

      <p>Have Fun With the Site!</p>
