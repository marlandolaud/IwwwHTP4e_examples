To start with an empty Guestbook database for the Guestbook example, rather than the version with three sample entries, simply rename the file Guestbook_EMPTY.mdf as Guestbook.mdf and use the renamed file instead.

We also provide SQL scripts to create the databases for this chapter from scratch in case you choose to use a database management system other than SQL Server 2005 Express.
